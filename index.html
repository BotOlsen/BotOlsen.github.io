						New college graduate in computer science with honors from California State University, Sacramento. I have

						Past projects I have worked on include a multitasking operating system written in C, a CPU with a custom ISA designed

						Currently learning about signal processing and general electrical engineering concepts in order to build a radio

								This operating system, cosmOS, is a multitasking operating system written using SPEDE 
								(System Programmers Educational Development Environment). This environment is a virtual 
								machine that mimics hardware for the OS to utilize and standardizes implementation 
								for various physical devices. 
								<br/><br/>
								The run loop for cosmOS starts by performing a context switch which will save the current
								processes trapframe. Then the interrupt handler will run on whatever interrupt triggered 
								the context switch. Once the interrupt is handled via itâ€™s interrupt service routine, the 
								OS determines if there has been a keyboard key press by the user. These commands can 
								create processes, exit processes, display kernel stats, and many more. After it has checked 
								for user input, it will run the scheduler with a round robin implementation. After the 
								scheduling, another context switch is performed, and the next process takes over the CPU.

								Wellness application for UC Davis Health developed as a part of a senior project. The main 
								feature of the application currently is the challenges portion of the application. Users 
								can schedule and attend challenges and events. This allows for easier planning of workplace 
								activities and helps with logistics involving number of attendees, location, and time. 
								<br><br>
								My personal contributions to the project were full stack. I worked on the frontend of the 
								application in designing small features like the navigation bar at the bottom and certain 
								settings pages. I utilized axios to allow for frontend button clicks to interact with our 
								API.  I developed many middleware functions and routes for the API. I researched JWT to 
								ensure our authentication within our API. With bcryptjs, I wrote a pre function to hash 
								passwords before they are saved into the database to ensure a data breach would not reveal 
								passwords. Lastly, I utilized nodemailer to allow for users to get a password reset token 
								in their email in case of forgotten passwords.

								This project is an astronomical interferometer. My plans for this project will be in 3 
								phases:<br><br>
								Phase 1: Write software to create images from signals (assign value to signal based 
								on frequency/strength and use that value to give it a color). Also connect hardware 
								and build the single dish telescope. <br><br>
								Phase 2: Scale software to allow for multiple sources of signals to create image and 
								have them work together to improve resolution. Add 2 more dishes to make a true 
								interferometer. <br><br>
								Phase 3: Scale up from a 3-dish unit to many groups of 3-dish units all working 
								together to improve resolution.

								Pipelined CPU designed and written to perform 16 functions in a custom ISA. The ISA can be 
								seen on GitHub. This synthesizable* CPU attempts to implement a hazard detection unit and

								This CPU uses parameterized registers to act as buffers between the stages which allows for

							<p class="project-description">
								Beware of Birds is a game where the player tries to get to the rooftops in order to save the 
								citizens atop. If a player can make it to all the rooftops in the particular order in which 
								they need help, the player wins. During gameplay, birds are flying around. Other helicopters 
								(aka birds) are also trying to prevent you from saving everyone. If they can collect their 
								own people from the rooftops, you lose. Collisions with helicopters and birds can cause 
								damage which slows you down and eventually ceases your movement. NPC helicopters have two 
								strategies they employ. They can either try to attack you and cause damage or beat you to 
								the rooftops and win the game. <br><br>
								This game was designed to be very cohesive and have minimal coupling. It also demonstrates 
								Object-Oriented Programming principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.
