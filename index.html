										<h3>Description</h3>
										<p>
											This operating system, cosmOS, is a multitasking operating system written using SPEDE 
											(System Programmers Educational Development Environment). This environment is a virtual 
											machine that mimics hardware for the OS to utilize and standardizes implementation 
											for various physical devices. 
											<br/><br/>
											The run loop for cosmOS starts by performing a context switch which will save the current
											 processes trapframe. Then the interrupt handler will run on whatever interrupt triggered 
											 the context switch. Once the interrupt is handled via it’s interrupt service routine, the 
											 OS determines if there has been a keyboard key press by the user. These commands can 
											 create processes, exit processes, display kernel stats, and many more. After it has checked 
											 for user input, it will run the scheduler with a round robin implementation. After the 
											 scheduling, another context switch is performed, and the next process takes over the CPU.

										<h3>Description</h3>
										<p>Beware of Birds is a game where the player tries to get to the rooftops in order to save the 
											citizens atop. If a player can make it to all the rooftops in the particular order in which 
											they need help, the player wins. During gameplay, birds are flying around. Other helicopters 
											(aka birds) are also trying to prevent you from saving everyone. If they can collect their 
											own people from the rooftops, you lose. Collisions with helicopters and birds can cause 
											damage which slows you down and eventually ceases your movement. NPC helicopters have two 
											strategies they employ. They can either try to attack you and cause damage or beat you to 
											the rooftops and win the game. <br/><br/>
											This game was designed to be very cohesive and have minimal coupling. It also demonstrates 
											Object-Oriented Programming principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

										<h3>Description</h3>
										<p>Pipelined CPU designed and written to perform 16 functions in a custom ISA. The ISA can be 
											seen on GitHub. This synthesizable* CPU attempts to implement a hazard detection unit and 
											successfully implements a forwarding unit to ensure efficiency in the pipeline. 
											<br/><br/>
											This CPU uses parameterized registers to act as buffers between the stages which allows for 
											reuse. Parameterized adder for use in various locations like the program counter incrementation 
											and jump offset addition.

										<h3>Description</h3>
										<p>Wellness application for UC Davis Health developed as a part of a senior project. The main 
											feature of the application currently is the challenges portion of the application. Users 
											can schedule and attend challenges and events. This allows for easier planning of workplace 
											activities and helps with logistics involving number of attendees, location, and time. 
											<br/><br/>
											My personal contributions to the project were full stack. I worked on the frontend of the 
											application in designing small features like the navigation bar at the bottom and certain 
											settings pages. I utilized axios to allow for frontend button clicks to interact with our 
											API.  I developed many middleware functions and routes for the API. I researched JWT to 
											ensure our authentication within our API. With bcryptjs, I wrote a pre function to hash 
											passwords before they are saved into the database to ensure a data breach would not reveal 
											passwords. Lastly, I utilized nodemailer to allow for users to get a password reset token 
											in their email in case of forgotten passwords.

										<h3>Description</h3>
										<p>This project is an astronomical interferometer. My plans for this project will be in 3 
											phases:<br/><br/>
											Phase 1: Write software to create images from signals (assign value to signal based 
											on frequency/strength and use that value to give it a color). Also connect hardware 
											and build the single dish telescope. <br/><br/>
											Phase 2: Scale software to allow for multiple sources of signals to create image and 
											have them work together to improve resolution. Add 2 more dishes to make a true 
											interferometer. <br/><br/>
											Phase 3: Scale up from a 3-dish unit to many groups of 3-dish units all working 
											together to improve resolution.
